# Lightweight-1D-CNN-with-CORAL-for-Cross-Load-Bearing-Fault-Diagnosis

Reliable bearing fault diagnosis is essential for maintaining the safety and efficiency of rotating machinery in industrial environments. However, models trained under one operating condition often struggle when applied to different loads due to domain shift in vibration signals. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) integrated with CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) for unsupervised domain adaptation. The 1D CNN, consisting of only three convolutional layers, efficiently learns discriminative features from raw vibration signals, while CORAL statistically aligns feature distributions between source and target load domains without requiring labeled target data. We evaluate the method on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset using drive-end acceleration signals sampled at 12 kHz. Results show that, compared to a baseline trained solely on source data, our approach improves cross-load generalization, raising accuracy from 83% to 85% and macro-F1 from 0.68 to 0.75, with particularly notable gains in inner race fault detection. The proposed framework is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and well-suited for real-time industrial deployment on embedded systems. These findings demonstrate that even simple statistical adaptation, when combined with a compact CNN, can significantly enhance fault diagnosis robustness across varying load conditions.
